# Classification of Consumer Complaints

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau publishes the Consumer Complaint Database, a collection of complaints about consumer financial products and services that were sent to companies for response. Complaints are published after the company responds, confirming a commercial relationship with the consumer, or after 15 days, whichever comes first.
