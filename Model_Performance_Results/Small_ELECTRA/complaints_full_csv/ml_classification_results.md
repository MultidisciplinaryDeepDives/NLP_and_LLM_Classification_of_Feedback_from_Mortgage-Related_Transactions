## Key Insights

### Strengths
- **Best performing category**: "Dealing with your lender or servicer" (84% F1-score)
- **High-volume success**: "Improper use of your report" performs well with 20,402 samples
- **Consistent performers**: Categories related to account management and payment processing

### Areas for Improvement
- **Poorest performer**: "False statements or representation" (22% F1-score) - very low recall (15%)
- **Debt collection categories**: Both "Attempts to collect debt not owed" and "Cont'd attempts collect debt not owed" show moderate to poor performance
- **Legal action detection**: "Took or threatened negative/legal action" has low precision and recall

### Model Balance
- **Macro Average**: Precision 65%, Recall 63%, F1-Score 64%
- **Weighted Average**: Precision 67%, Recall 67%, F1-Score 67%
- The weighted averages being higher suggests better performance on high-volume categories
