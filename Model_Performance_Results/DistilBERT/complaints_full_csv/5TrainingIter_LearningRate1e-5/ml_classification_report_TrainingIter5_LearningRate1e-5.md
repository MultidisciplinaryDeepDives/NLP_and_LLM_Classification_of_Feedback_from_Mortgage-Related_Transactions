## Key Insights

### Strengths
- **High-volume categories** like "Improper use of your report" (20,402 samples) and "Incorrect information on your report" (45,861 samples) show strong performance
- **Credit reporting issues** generally well-classified
- **Account management** categories perform consistently well

### Areas Needing Attention
- **Debt collection categories** show lower performance, particularly "False statements or representation" (36% F1) and "Took or threatened negative/legal action" (45% F1)
- **Payment-related issues** have moderate performance and may benefit from additional training data
- Categories with **lower sample sizes** tend to have more variable performance

### Recommendations
1. **Collect more training data** for underperforming categories, especially debt collection issues
2. **Feature engineering** around debt collection language patterns
3. **Consider class balancing** techniques for categories with low support
4. **Review misclassifications** in the 36-52% F1-score range for pattern identification
