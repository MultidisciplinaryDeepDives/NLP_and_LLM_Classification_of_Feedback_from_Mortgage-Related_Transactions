## Key Insights

### Strengths
- **Account Management**: Categories related to account management and credit reporting perform well
- **Large Sample Categories**: High-volume categories like "Incorrect information on your report" (45K samples) maintain good performance
- **Specific Issues**: Well-defined problems like mortgage dealings and purchase disputes show strong classification

### Areas for Improvement
- **Debt Collection**: Multiple debt-related categories show poor performance, suggesting difficulty distinguishing between similar complaint types
- **Legal Actions**: "Took or threatened negative/legal action" has the second-lowest F1-score (44%)
- **False Statements**: Lowest performing category (35% F1-score) indicates challenges in identifying deceptive practices

### Recommendations
1. **Focus on Debt Categories**: Improve feature engineering for debt-related complaints to better distinguish between subcategories
2. **Address Class Imbalance**: Some categories have very different sample sizes, which may affect performance
3. **Feature Enhancement**: Consider adding domain-specific features for poorly performing categories
4. **Data Quality**: Review labeling consistency for categories with low precision or recall
